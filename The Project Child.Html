                <h3> 2023 Season: A season for the record books</h3>
                <p> Verstappen remained with Red Bull alongside 
                Sergio Pérez for the 2023 season. Verstappen 
                achieved consistently high results throughout 
                the season, setting several Formula One records, 
                including his win at the Hungarian Grand Prix, 
                which broke the record for most consecutive wins 
                by a constructor at twelve, previously held by 
                McLaren in 1988 with eleven,[240][241] and the 
                Italian Grand Prix, which marked his tenth 
                consecutive win, breaking Sebastian Vettel's 
                previous record of nine set in 2013.
                His ten consecutive wins include a grand 
                slam at the 2023 Spanish Grand Prix.
                After a brief slump in Singapore - which saw him 
                finish fifth and his record-setting streak of ten 
                consecutive wins be broken - Verstappen took 
                pole position once again in Suzuka, the track where 
                he achieved his 2022 title, and led the field ahead 
                of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri to secure 
                Red Bull Racing its sixth Constructors' 
                Championship title - and also Red Bull's 
                second consecutive title after its victory in 
                2022.During the sprint for the following 
                Qatar Grand Prix, Verstappen finished second 
                from Oscar Piastri while Pérez did not finish, 
                handing the 2023 Drivers' Championship to 
                Verstappen,who joined Juan Manuel Fangio, 
                Jack Brabham, Graham Hill, Keke Rosberg, and 
                Nelson Piquet as the only drivers to have won a 
                championship on a Saturday.
